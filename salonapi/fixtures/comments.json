I can tell dodged some of the shadow to bring out what is inside, and it turned out well, though could have been a little more subtle around the edge. I also like the way you framed the photo, and the way you used the light to bring out the details. I think you could have used a little more light to bring out the details in the background, but overall, it was a great photo.",
